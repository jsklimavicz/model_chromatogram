# Data Sources

Compounds for the compound library were chosen based on compounds that were present in the NIST spectral library with .jdx UV-Vis absorbance files. SMILES strings were found either in PubChem (NIH) or by drawing the structure in ChemDraw. 

Hydrogen bond donors, aceptors, and logP values were determined using SwissADME (http://www.swissadme.ch/)
